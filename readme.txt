So, the "Bike Sales Dashboard" is an Excel project that I'm working on to get some insights into how our bike company is doing. It's got all kinds of different things on it that I think will be helpful.

One of the things we're tracking is the average income per purchase. I think this will be really helpful for us because we can see how much people are spending when they buy a bike from us. This will give us some good ideas about how we should price things and how we can improve our marketing.

We're also looking at customer age brackets, which is going to be really interesting. It will give us a sense of what kinds of people are buying our bikes and what their preferences are. This way, we can make sure that we're offering the right products for the right age groups.

Another thing we're tracking is customer commute. This will help us understand how people are using our bikes to get around, and we can use that information to improve our products and marketing.

We're also looking at marital status, region, and education. I think all of these things are going to be really helpful for us to understand our customers better and to make sure that we're offering the right products and marketing campaigns.

Overall, the Bike Sales Dashboard is going to give us a really good view of how our bike company is doing. I'm excited to see what we can learn from it and how we can use that information to make some positive changes for our business.
